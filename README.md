# 👋 Hi, I'm Ofir David

<p>
<img align="right" src="./Poincare rotations200.gif" alt="Ofir David" width = 100/>

I'm a mathematician with a deep interest in computer science — especially its intersections with mathematical theory and applications. I use this GitHub space to explore, document, and share projects where math comes alive through code.

My work spans from algorithmic experiments and educational tools, to interactive visualizations and game-like environments built in Unity. Whether through Python scripts, C# for Unity, or web-based tools, I aim to make complex ideas more intuitive and engaging.

While GitHub hosts most of my (online) code-focused work, I also share the more visual centric projects on other platforms like OpenProcessing and Shadertoy. This and much more can be found in my [homepage](https://prove-me-wrong.com/).

## 🔍 Algorithm Explorations

These repositories explore classic and modern algorithms in areas like machine learning, compression, encryption and more. Each includes detailed Jupyter notebooks explaining the logic behind the implementation and the mathematical intuition.

- 🤖 [AI projects](https://github.com/TotallyReal/ai_projects)  
  *Implementations of learning algorithms from scratch, with many notebooks exploring the motivation and logic behind them. Highlights include:*
  1. **📝 Text generation**: from probabilistic models, through basic neural networks and up to transformers.
  2. **📊 Core machine learning techniques**: such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  3. **🖼️ Computer Vision**: image classification, and geometric vision tasks like building panoramas and 3D reconstructions from 2D images.

- 📦 [Compression algorithms](https://github.com/TotallyReal/compressions)  
  *A visual and mathematical breakdown of compression algorithms, covering both text and image compression — with video compression coming soon.*


## 🎮 Interactive Mathematics

These projects use Unity to create game-like or interactive environments that explore mathematical concepts in engaging and intuitive ways. 

- 🧊 [Polyhedron Nets](https://github.com/TotallyReal/Polyhedron-Nets)  
  *Explore 3D polyhedrons by "cutting" them into 2D surfaces (called [nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron))) and "gluing" them back together.*

- 🔀 [Permutations Game](https://github.com/TotallyReal/Permutations_Game)  
  *Building puzzles based on the fascinating properties of permutations.*

- 🌳 [Binary tree balancing](https://github.com/TotallyReal/Binary-Trees)
  *Get a hands-on feel for tree rotations with this puzzle-like game about balancing binary search trees — playable right in your browser.*

- 🕶️ AR projects
  *Currently, I don’t have any public repositories for my augmented reality (AR) projects, but you can see them on my [homepage](https://prove-me-wrong.com/programming-projects/).*

## 🧮 Mathematical Libraries

These repositories provide general-purpose tools and utilities for mathematical computation and experimentation. They’re designed to be reusable components in larger projects or for standalone exploration.

- ➗ [Zaremba conjecture & continued fractions](https://github.com/TotallyReal/continued_fractions)  
  *Tools for experimenting with continued fractions, with a focus on Zaremba’s conjecture and number-theoretic insights.*

- 🖊️ [Simple math visualization](https://github.com/TotallyReal/MathVisuals)  
  *Basic utilities for generating LaTeX expressions and plotting graphs to visualize mathematical functions.*

- 🔢 [Mapping field](https://github.com/TotallyReal/mapping_field)  
  *A symbolic computation library where both parameters and functions act as variables — inspired by SymPy.*


## 📘 Interactive Lecture Notes

A web-based set of lecture notes on Fourier Analysis, combining explanatory text, image and video visualizations, and interactive programs. You can view the live site [here](https://totallyreal.github.io/Fourier_Notes/notes/Fourier/Motivation). Built with Jekyll, HTML, and custom scripts for a smooth and engaging reading experience.

- 📖 [Fourier Analysis Notes](https://github.com/TotallyReal/Fourier_Notes)  
  *The full content of the interactive lecture notes — including explanations, animations, and interactive examples.*

- ⚙️ [Site Generator](https://github.com/TotallyReal/jekyll-gitbook-Fourier)  
  *The code and tooling behind the website — built with Jekyll, HTML/CSS.*


## 🌍 Beyond GitHub

Many of my more visual or artistic programming experiments — including shaders, interactive sketches, and generative visuals — live outside GitHub:

- 🎨 [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/user/133765/?view=sketches)
- 🧪 [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/TotallyReal)
- 🌐 [Personal Homepage](https://prove-me-wrong.com)

Feel free to explore these as well!

## ⚡ Fun Fact

The name **TotallyReal** comes from field theory: a number field is called *totally real* if all its embeddings into the complex numbers actually land in the real numbers. 

So in a sense — no imaginary parts, but still plenty of structure.
